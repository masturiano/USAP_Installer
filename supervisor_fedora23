Supervisor Installation on fedora 23

    dnf install supervisor
    echo_supervisord_conf > /etc/supervisord.conf

    nano /etc/supervisord.conf

    Add the following to the conf. file (THIS IS JUST A TEMPLATE)

    [program:laravel-worker]
    process_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d
    command=php /vhosts/myapp/artisan queue:work --queue=birthday_email --sleep=3 --tries=3 --daemon
    autostart=true
    autorestart=true
    user=apache
    numprocs=8
    redirect_stderr=true
    stdout_logfile=/vhosts/myapp/storage/logs/supervisor.log

This is an example of a call to put a laravel queue to work: php /vhosts/myapp/artisan queue:work --queue=birthday_email --sleep=3 --tries=3 --daemon

    Delete the file supervisor.sock wherever it is ( find / -name supervisor.sock )
    service supervisord start (Check if the service is running)
    Login to supervisor with the command supervisor ( supervisorctl )
    Within the supervisor prompt run reread and then update

Trouble shooting:

>touch /tmp/supervisor.sock
>supervisord
>supervisorctl
