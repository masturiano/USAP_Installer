Gearman is used to distribute appropriate computer tasks to multiple computers, so large tasks can be done more quickly.

Gearman can be simply installed by the command

$ yum install gearmand

And in servers which are Debain/Ubuntu, installed using the command

apt-get install gearman-job-server

Once the job server has been installed, it can be started by running:

$ gearmand -d

It can also be installed from source file

First download any latest tarball from Download [Gearman Job Server]

$ tar xzf gearmand-X.Y.tar.gz

$ cd gearmand-X.Y

$ ./configure

$ make

$ make install [1]
